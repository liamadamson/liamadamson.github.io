title: Hi, I'm Liam!
---

I'm an embedded software engineer from the UK. I've spent the last few years working on various cleantech projects and specialise in ***Embedded Linux*** and ***IoT***. I'm currently working at **Engie** in a small team that's developing a new embedded Linux device for grid flexibility services across the UK and EU.

I've only just set up this site, so don't expect too much for now; hopefully there'll be some blog posts and a bit more about me in the near future! In the meantime, feel free to reach out to me by [email](mailto:liam@liamadamson.co.uk) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liam-adamson-2b8b0a151/).
